# 16_Portfolio_Update3
I have updated my third portfolio using bootstrap and projects from the later part of class. My portfolio should tell you a little more about myself, some of the work I conducted in class and with my peers, and finally contact information to get in touch. In this portfolio I also made my website more readable, all external facing links will now go to a new tab, and I also linked my github profile. Don't hesitate to reach out! 

## Portfolio Requirements:
* Updated portfolio featuring at least 3 examples of student work from either deployed projects of homeworks

* Update GitHub profile with pinned repositories featuring at least 3 examples of student work from either deployed projects of homeworks

* Updated resume

* Updated LinkedIn profile
